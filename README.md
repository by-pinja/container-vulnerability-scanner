## Problem domain

Theres many ready to use registry scanners available, however each registry system uses it's own and we like to integrate checks also for CI. We already tested CLAIR as valid solution for scanning. However we want to use it in multiple locations: CI and montly production cluster scanning. Addition to this it is important that we can collect reports to single point instead of fragmented locations (like each registry by its own).

Responsibility to pushing new data to this service is by agents which are tailored for each docker container service type. For example k8s and azure web app containers are two very different use cases but both require constant monitoring. In kubernetes theres agent software running in each cluster which get all images from deployments and send them to api for analysis.

## Setting up local development

`compose` folder contains local instance for clair and klar template that development mode can call. Fist edit `dockerhub.env` file and add your dockerhub username and password. These are needed because without them images from dockerhub cannot be pull properly. File is ignored so your secrets should never get committed to CVS. This is temporary solution since actually we must support multiple targets as source (private and public repositories) in custom locations like GCR.

```bash
cd compose && docker-compose up
```

Then in another terminal

```bash
dotnet watch run
```
