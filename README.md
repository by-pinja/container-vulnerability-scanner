# container-vulnerability-scanner
Common simple rest API to scan docker images.

## Problem domain
Theres many ready to use registry scanners available, however each registry system uses it's own and we like to integrate checks also for CI. We already tested CLAIR as valid solution for scanning. However we want to use it in multiple locations: CI and montly production cluster scanning. Addition to this it is important that we can collect reports to single point instead of fragmented locations (like each registry by its own).
